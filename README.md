# CSES solutions

Solutions to competetitive programming problems provided by http://cses.fi

These problems are here on GitHub mostly for my own convenience of accessing them on multiple devices. Having the repository public might also be helpful for other problem solvers just to gain new insight. However, most comments (if they exist in the first place) are in Finnish because I'm wired that way. More descriptive comments and model solutions might be coming in the future.
